# Computer Vision Project Collection

The projects included in this repository are 

1. Predicting if patients has leukemia based on the blood sample image - using basic image processing algorithms 
2. Solving the CAPTCHA problem - using ANN model and image segmentation
3. Predicting age, race and gender based on a face image - using HOG descriptor, SVM model, dlib and face landmarks techniques
4. Retrieving information from image documents (ID cards) - using Tesseract and advanced image processing techniques

# How to get it running

* Run main.py script in Python 3.x environment. 
* Datasets used to train models are omitted. If you wish to train model, provide dataset.
* Project #3 requires shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file. Before running, you should provide it.
* For evaluation, run evaluate.py.
